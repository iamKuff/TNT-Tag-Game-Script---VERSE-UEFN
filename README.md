# TNT-Tag-Game-Script---VERSE-UEFN
This script creates a full TNT Tag game where players pass TNT to each other. It manages timers, explosions, player interactions, Sound effects and UI updates with countdowns. It freezes players during explosions and resets them after each round.

I started developing this script for my game but unfortunately lost motivation to continue. However, I think it’s a great script, and I’m giving it away for free to help out the community and provide some educational value. It’s fully functional, and I hope it can be a useful resource for others. Please feel free to contact me if you want to improve the code or if you notice any bugs. I’m always happy to hear suggestions and collaborate on enhancements! I’m very sorry I cannot link any of the assets I used; however, you can easily find free sound effects and objects/props like TNT on Sketchfab. If I have missed any information that is vital, let me know. If this snippet gains enough attraction, I will post a full tutorial on my YouTube channel.
